# Freight Data Programming Challenge: Vessel Analysis

### Repository Description

The repository contains the following directories and files:
 - data: A directory containing the CSV files of the two datasets used in this analysis: vessel_positions.csv and vessel_characteristics.csv.
 - vessel-analysis.ipynb: The Python notebook containing all the code of this project.
 - This README file.

### Notebook

The notebook consists of multiple cells, each for a function definition or for a separate major section of the code. The code can be run sequentially from the beginning all at once.
Alternatively, if only one section if the code is needed (e.g. map of geographical analysis), it can be run by itself given that the data is loaded and converted to the appropriate data types.

### Running the Code

**Clone the repo**  
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sa-mV/vessel-analysis.git
   cd vessel-analysis
```
Afterwards, use the software of your choice to open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or navigate using the file system to the directory where you cloned the repository and open it from there.
